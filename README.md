# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application through Mongoose. The goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

The project set up the schemas, controller, routes and error messages for both users and clothing items.

### Testing

The back-end database is checked by two tools- Postman and
MongoDB compass. Postman helped us inspect each API
we set up and MongoDB compass visualized the database so that it
is more easier for us to see whether the data is sent to the database
correctly.
